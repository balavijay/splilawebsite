                    <p class="abtUsP1"> ‘Jagganath’ literally means ‘Lord of The Universe’. The Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, Himself manifested in a transcendental form of 
						Lord Jagannath along with His elder brother Baladeva (Balarama) and His sister, Lady Subhadra.</p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> After the disappearance of Lord Krishna, influence of Kali yuga spread far and wide. Vedic culture and knowledge about Jagannath shrunk to 
						the boundaries of Indian subcontinent; now only well known in the states of Bengal and Orissa alone. He was known to the masses only for the famous ‘Ratha Yatra’, 
						which was the world’s largest human gathering. But today, Jagannath rides on His transcendental chariots, with Baladeva and Subhadra, in all major cities of world; 
						at the same time, when He rides on the Ratha at Jagannath Puri!</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> How did this phenomenon occur? How did Jagannath come to reign over the whole world!? What role did the commander-in-chief of Lord Chaitanya’s army; 
						our beloved Spiritual Master Srila Prabhupada play in making this happen? </p>

                    <p class="abtUsP1"> ‘Cost Plus’, the first import store of USA, in the San Francisco’s fisherman wharf, changed the face of shopping in America. It was the first store 
						to bring variety of goods from Asia. Unknown to even ‘Cost Plus’ store-keepers they had imported the ‘Lord of Universe’ in 1967; from India; who was waiting to be 
						discovered, to spark a spiritual revolution in the next decade of American history. </p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> In early March of 1967, an early disciple of Srila Prabhupada, Malati Devi Dasi, who was in charge of shopping for the temple’s groceries; came across 
						a barrel full of tiny three-inch dolls of black, white and red, in the San Francisco’s ‘Cost Plus’ import store. </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> When she noticed that these three inch dolls held the label of ‘Made in India’, she brought the black shiny doll, with big round eyes and a red smiling 
						mouth; with her, back to the temple. Unknown to her, she had just brought ‘The Lord of Universe’: Jagannath with her to this City of the West Coast, far away from 
						the Eastern Land of Puri, where He originally resides. </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Jagannath was ready to manifest now, shortly, all over the world; and live up to His name: ‘Lord of the Universe’! </p>

						He is worshiped in Puri–Jagannatha Puri, for thousands of years, along with two other deities: His brother, Balarama, and His sister, Subhadra”.</p>

						Jagannath in San Francisco.” </p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> Srila Prabhupada wanted to know if anyone could carve from wood, and Malati said, “Oh, yeah, Shyamasundara; he likes to carve wood.” </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Srila Prabhupada then told the whole story of how wooden logs had floated up from the ocean at Puri, and were used to carve the Deities. 
						Shyamasundara went looking for wood from a ship-dismantling yard, and found a big suitable log of red-wood and brought it back. He began to carve out three-feet 
						sized versions of Jagannath, Baladeva and Subhadra, and Srila Prabhupada being pleased said, “When they are ready, we shall install them in our temple here.

						to inspect the work one day, he notices the cigarette pack on top of Lord Jagannath. After appreciating Syamasundara for his sincere service of carving the Deities,
						Prabhupada motions to the cigarette pack and quietly mentions, “Such a small thing that is separating us from Kåñëa.” Shyamasundara was touched by the words, and 
						vowed to give up smoking from that day. </p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> Syamasundara gets the Deities carved the way Srila Prabhupada wants, and paints them up, just as the original Deities at Puri. Jagannath had 
						transcendentally appeared at the East Coast of India, in ages gone-by and the place became famous as Jagannath Puri. Now after thousands of years, Lord Jagannath, 
						made His glorious reappearance at the West Coast of America, San Francisco. Inspired by the transcendental coincidence, Srila Prabhupada named ISKCON’s second temple, 
						‘New Jagannath Puri’.</p>

                    <p class="abtUsP1"> Lord Jagannatha was very liberal and merciful to the most fallen, Srila Prabhupada explained, He could be worshiped in 
						a simple way, even if the devotees weren't very much advanced. He set March 26, 1967, the appearance day of Lord Caitanya, for installing 
						the first set of Deities in ISKCON.  </p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> The new altar that stood in the rear of the room, was a simple redwood plank seven feet above the floor and fixed between 
						two thick redwood pillars. A canopy covered the place where the deities would stand. Below the altar hung a painting of Lord Caitanya and 
						His associates dancing during kirtana. The deities wore no clothes or ornaments, but were freshly painted in bright black, red, white, 
						green, yellow, and blue.  </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Prabhupada had had the devotees arrange for a large candle on a plate and he made the devotees and guests one after another 
						come up and offer the flame in circles before the Jagannatha deities. This is arati” he said. </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Although in big temples in India the installation of the Deity was a complex, exact procedure, requiring several days of 
						continuous rituals directed by priests, in San Francisco there were no brahmana priests, and the many other standards would be impossible 
						to maintain. Srila Prabhupada prayed that Lord Jagannatha-the Lord of the universe would not be offended by His reception at New Jagannatha 
						Puri. </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Prabhupada passed his hands across the flame and touched them to his forehead. "Yes," he said, "show everyone. Each and every 
						one. Whatever they can contribute. Here, take it like this and show everyone." As the candle plate went from person to person, a few devotees 
						dropped some coins on the plate, and others followed. </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> "Another thing I request you: All the devotees-when you come to the temple, you bring one fruit and one flower. If you can

						they took Jagannath to the Golden Gate Park for chanting in the park and put Him down on the lawns beside the chanting party. </p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> When Srila Prabhupada heard about this occurrence, he walked over to the park at a very fast pace —and when he saw 
						Jagannath, he offered his obeisances. </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Srila Prabhupada told the devotees, “You cannot take Jagannath out like that whenever you want. People come to the 
						temple to visit the Lord, but Jagannath does not go out to see the people. He never goes anywhere without His brother and sister. 
						The Deities come out of the temple only on the yearly car festival, known as Ratha Yatra, on Their own ratha, or wooden car.” </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> As Srila Prabhupada instructs the devotees, he takes this incident to be Lord Jagannath’s desire to have a <em>Ratha 
						Yatra at San Francisco</em>. </p>

                    <p class="abtUsP1"> Lord Jagannath’s transcendental wish to give darshan to American public at Golden Gate Park, set Srila Prabhupada thinking 
						about the annual Ratha Yatra festival. </p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> The next morning, Srila Prabhupada was looking down at the street through his apartment’s window, and told Mukunda, 
						“I have been watching trucks. You know, this kind of truck with–platform behind the driver. Flatbed truck. I am thinking this vehicle 
						would make good Ratha-yatra cart.”  </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> “I have made drawing. You please look here,” he said. On a lined pad of paper he had made an ink drawing of a flatbed 
						truck with a four-pillar canopy. “So, this canopy will be made of cloth,” And deities of Jagannath, Baladeva and Subhadra will sit below 
						the canopy. They will be tied to these boards,” he said, “Baladeva will face left side, Subhadra will face behind, and Jagannath will face 
						right side. In this way you may convert this flatbed truck into deity cart for festival. This will be the American style of Ratha-yatra”  </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Then he said, “There should be big kirtan with flags and banners. The deity car should drive slowly, and everyone should 
						follow chanting beside. We will have big festival and feast. It should ride to San Francisco beach, just like Ratha-yatra chariots in 
						India. Every year there Jagannath goes to seashore. Then grand parade returns the deities to the temple. Here our temple is by the sea 
						just as in Puri, so we should do the same. It will be very nice.” </p>

                    <p class="abtUsP1"> ISKCON’s first set of Deities were installed, and daily worship was established. Srila Prabhupada was now ready to head back to his first ‘temple’ at New York’s 26, Second Avenue.</p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> The storefront at Haight-Ashbury was no longer a mere storefront but had become something worthy: New Jagannatha Puri. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati had asked him to come here. Who could imagine how crazy these American hippies were! So many girls and boys-unhappy, mad, despite their wealth and education. But now, through Krishna consciousness, some were finding happiness.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Now the devotees were a family. If they followed his instructions and were sincere, Krishna would help them. They would be purified by chanting Hare Krishna and daily worship of the Deities. Lord Jagannatha was present, and the devotees would have to worship Him faithfully.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> At the airport the devotees were crying. But Srila Prabhupada assured them he would return if they would hold a Ratha-Yatra festival. "You must arrange a procession down the main street," he told them. "Do it nicely. We must attract many people. They have such a procession yearly in Jagannatha Puri. At this time the Deity may leave the temple." Repeatedly he promised them he would return and asked them to cooperate among themselves.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> With Srila Prabhupada’s departure to New York, all the devotees at San Francisco worked towards fulfilling the desire of their spiritual master- to organize the Western World’ at San Francisco, now ‘New Jagannatha Puri’.</p>

                    <p class="abtUsP1"> “You all please maintain the center nicely. I will return to San Francisco for Ratha Yatra in July.” Srila Prabhupada had said at the airport when he departed to New York. Devotees maintained the daily routine of morning and evening programs, Sunday Love Feast and the park chanting. All the while they were eagerly expecting his return in July.</p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> Then, on June 1st, they received a phone call from New York informing that Srila Prabhupada had suffered a stroke and was in critical condition in Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. Doctors told devotees to be prepared that he might not live through the night.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Srila Prabhupada had given a special prayer to the devotees to chant all night and pray to Lord Nrisimha-deva, thinking, “Our master has not finished his work. Please protect him.”</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> There was a tremendous love and anxiety to have Srila Prabhupada recover from the crisis. Devotees kept the temple open all night, turned on the altar lights behind Jagannatha, lit candles, and chanted solemnly. News quickly spread down Haight Street, and soon the temple was crowded with people who came to chant through the night.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Next day an airmail arrived from Srila Prabhupada: </p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> “My dear boys and girls, I am so much obliged to you for your prayers to Krishna to save my life. Due to your sincere and ardent prayer, Krishna has saved my life. I was to die on Tuesday certainly but because you prayed sincerely I am saved. Now I am improving gradually and coming to original condition. As soon as I get a little strength for traveling I shall come to San Francisco. In the meantime I shall be very glad to know what arrangements you are going to do for the Ratha Yatra festival. Make it a grand procession and unique introduction in the United States. Most probably I will be able to come to S.F. by the 25th of this month. Thanking you once more, Your ever well-wisher, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.”</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> Srila Prabhupada was completely absorbed in serving Lord Jagannatha, and His Ratha Yatra so soon after almost dying. This letter gave devotees all renewed enthusiasm for organizing the Ratha Yatra, which they had all but forgotten in the turmoil since Srila Prabhupada’s stroke.</p>

                    <p class="abtUsP1"> Srila Prabhupada’s thank you letter from his hospital bed even in his fragile condition, urging the devotees to organize Ratha Yatra and his desire to visit New Jagannath Puri as soon as he recovered, gave the devotees renewed enthusiasm for organizing the Ratha Yatra, which they had all but forgotten in the turmoil since Srila Prabhupada’s stroke.</p>
                    <p class="abtUsP2"> Mukunda wanted to know more about the festival itself, so he spent a day in the library reading up about it. He found out that it had been held for thousands of years and that it was India’s largest outdoor festival. Over a million people attended every year. Even though the San Francisco’s Ratha Yatra would be tiny in comparison, it was exciting enough for it was America’s first-ever Ratha Yatra.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2">At the end of June, Srila Prabhupada went to the hospital for a checkup. The doctor was surprised at Srila Prabhupada's recovery and had no objection to his flying to San Francisco. So in search of sunny skies, and eager to guide his followers in performing the first Ratha-Yatra, Prabhupada flew to San Francisco, New Jagannatha Puri.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> At the San Francisco airport Prabhupada smiled but said little as the devotees greeted him with flowers and kirtana. Jayananda was waiting with his station wagon to drive Prabhupada to the private house they had rented north of the city, at Stinson Beach. But first, Prabhupada said, he wanted to visit the San Francisco Radha-Krishna temple. Jayananda drove to 518 Frederick Street. Prabhupada got out of the car and entered the small storefront, which was filled with waiting devotees and guests. He bowed before the smiling Jagannatha deities and, without speaking a word, left the room, returned to the car, and departed for Stinson Beach.</p>
					<p class="abtUsP2"> The house at Stinson Beach, called Paradisio, had a large living room overlooking the Pacific Ocean was decorated with some of Jadurani's paintings of Lord Vishnu, Radha and Krishna, and Lord Caitanya, as well as with Indian prints of Jagannatha Puri. Prabhupada's bedroom, also facing the ocean, had sliding windows. On the wall was a portrait of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and a painting of Radha and Krishna. Prabhupada smiled and said the paintings were very nice. As he spent the days recuperating from his illness, he was also eagerly anticipating for the historic event to come… The Western world’s first Ratha Yatra!</p>
